<h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>
        In this section, we explore one category matching. Suppose a group of students will be matched to roommates, two in each room.
        We consider four students:
        <ul>
    <li>$A$ prefers $B \succ C \succ D$</li>
    <li>$B$ prefers $C \succ A \succ D$</li>
    <li>$C$ prefers $A \succ B \succ D$</li>
</ul>
        Then <b><i>no stable matching exists</i></b>: whoever is paired with $D$ wants to change and can find a willing partner, so the existence of a stable matching is not trivial, even if each match inovlves just two people.
