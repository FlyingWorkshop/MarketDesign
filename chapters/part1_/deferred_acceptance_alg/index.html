            Men and women rank all potential partners.
<!--?    TODO: add links that explain acceptability-->
            <ol>
                <li>Each man proposes to the highest ranked acceptable woman on his list, or to nobody if no one the list is acceptable.</li>
                <li>Each woman holds only her most preferred acceptable proposal and rejects all others.</li>
                <li>Each $m$ who is rejected by a woman removes her from his list.</li>
                <li>If any man $m$ is rejected, return to step 1.</li>
                <li>If no man is rejected, then each woman "accepts" her offer and is matched to the man whose proposal she holds.</li>

            This is the <b>"man-proposing"</b> deferred acceptance algorithm; there is also a <b>"woman-proposing"</b> version.

            <b id="alg">Theorem:</b>
            <br>
    The deferred acceptance algorithm ends in finite time with a stable matching. (In particular, a stable matching exists).

	<b>Proof:</b><br/>
    The algorithm must end in a finite number of rounds. Suppose $m$ and $w$ are matched. Each must be acceptable to the other. (Why?) There is no blocking pair $(m, w')$ because if $m$ prefers $w'$ to $w$, then (1) at some time, $m$ <i>had</i> proposed to $w'$ and she eventually rejected him. Either $m$ is unacceptable to $w'$ or she then held a man she preferred to $m$. At every later round, $w'$ held the same man or some more preferred one, so $w'$ prefers her final match to $m$. Therefore, there are <b><i>NO BLOCKING PAIRS</i></b>. $\blacksquare$
