<h2>Game Theory and Mechanism Design</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Classical game theory</b> analyzes strategic behavior:
        <ul>
            <li>Given a strategic environment (a "game"), what can we say about the likely outcome?</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Mechanism design</b> flips the problem around
        <ul>
            <li>How can we create rules of play (a "mechanism") so that even if players are strategically sophisticated,
                we still get a desired outcome?
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<div class="bordered"><b>Definition:</b><br>
    A <b>game</b> in a strategic form is a triple $(N, A, u)$ consisting of
    <ul>
        <li>A set of players $N = \{1, \ldots, n\}$</li>
        <li>Possible <i>actions</i> for each player: $A_1, \ldots, A_n$</li>
        <li>Payoff functions for each player: $u_i(a_1, \ldots, a_n)$ for $u: A_1 \times \dots \times A_n \to
            \mathbb{R}^n$
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
The game is commonly known to players.
<div class="bordered"><b>Definition:</b><br> Action $a_i$ is (weakly) <b><i>dominant</i></b> for player $i$if for
    <b>all</b> $a_i'$ and $a_{-1}$:
    $$u_i(a_i, a_{-1} \geq u_i(a_i', a_{-i})$$
    and for <b>some</b> $\hat{a}_{-i}$,
    $$u_i(a_i, \hat{a}_{-i}) > u_i(a_i', \hat{a}_{-i}).$$
</div>
<p>
    It's a no-brainer for $i$ to play a dominant action if she has one; it is an optimal choice <i>regardless of how the
    others may play</i>
</p>

<div class="bordered"><b>Definition: <i>Nash Equilbrium</i></b><br> Action profile $a = (a_1, \ldots, a_n)$ is a <b><i>Nash
    equilibrium</i></b> if for each player $i$ and action $a_i'$, $$U_i(a_i, a_{-i}) \geq u_i(a_i', a_{-1})$$. In words,
    an action profile $a$ is a Nash equilibrium if no player $i$ can increase its own payoff above $u_i(a)$ by
    unilaterally changing in its action from $a_i$ to some other action $a_i'$.
</div>
<h2>Incomplete Information</h2>
<ul>
    <li>What happens if the players don't know each other's payoff functions? For example, in an auction, players may
        not know the other bidders' valuations.
    </li>
    <li>(Bayesian) Nash equilibrium is more subtle: each player's optimal choice depends on what it believes other will
        play, so it needs to decide about probabilities to decide what is best.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Allocation Problems</h2>
<p>
    An allocation problem consists of player $i = 1, \ldots, n$, a set of possible outcomes or allocations $X$, and
    (possibly) payments by each player $p_1, \ldots, p_n$, and value functions $v_i(x)$ such that the payoff for each
    player is $v_i(x) - p_i$.
    <b>Challenge: </b> the <i>mechanism designer</i> typically does not know the payoff functions! The function is the player's privately known "type."
</p>
        <h3>"Good" Allocations</h3>
        <p>
Various criteria may define "good" allocations or outcomes. In auction problems, a good allocation might be one that is <i>Pareto efficient</i> given everyone's values, or one that has high revenue for the seller. In matching problems, a good allocation might be one that is <i>stable</i>.
        </p>
        <h2>Mechanisms</h2>
        <div class="bordered"><b>Definition: <i>mechanism</i></b><br>
            A mechanism $(M, x, p)$ is a triple consisting of
            <ul>
                <li>A set of possible <i>messages</i> for each player: $M_1, \ldots, M_n$</li>
                <li>An allocation rule: $X(m_1, \ldots, m_n)</li>
                <li>Possibly: a payment rule $p: M_1 \times \ldots \times M_n \to \mathbb{R}^n$ where player $i$ pays $p_i(m_1, \ldots, m_n)$.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>We will look at mechanisms with and without payments. If there are no payments, set all $p_i \equiv 0$.</p>
        <div class="purpleBox"><b>Example 1: Gayle-Shapley Marriage Problem</b><br>
        In the Gale-Shapley marriage problem, the messages are statements of preference (not necessarily truthful). The outcome/allocation/assignment is a matching, which the mechanism selects as a function of the reported preferences. No payments are made. A "type" is the preference list of each agent.
            <br>
            <b>Example 2: Simple Auction</b><br>
            In a simple auction problem, the messages are the bids $(b_i \geq 0)$. The auction mechanism determines who wins and what everyone must pay as a function of the bids. A type is typically a person's value (maximum price).
        </div>
        <p>
            A mechanism plus payoffs defines a game. The possible actions are the messages: $M_1, \ldots, M_n$. The payoffs are functions of the messages
            $$u_i(m_1, \ldots, m_n) = v_{i}\left(x\left(m_{1},\ldots,m_{n}\right)\right) - p_i(m_1, \ldots, m_n).$$
            Often, we will focus on <i> direct mechanisms</i>: $M_i$ is equal to the set of $i$'s possible payoff functions (or preferences).
        </p>
        <h2>Strategy-proof Mechanisms</h2>
        <p>
        A <i>strategy/action</i> for player $i$ specifies what message to send as a function of player $i$'s type. A mechanism is <i>strategy-proof</i> if each player $i$ has a dominant strategy, that is, a strategy that is optimal regardless of the strategies chosen by the other players. Sometimes, we'll look at mechanisms that are not strategy-proof, using Nash-equilibrium to forecast mechanism outcomes.

        <h2>Applying GT to Market Design</h2>
        <h3>Studying existing markets</h3>
        <p>Identify the "rules of the game," the incentives for participants, and how they behave. Then try ot understand why the market functions well, or not so well.</p>
        <h3>Designing new markets</h3>
        <p>Identify the economic problem to be solved, the players and their incentives and information. Then try to understand what sort of market rules would lead to a good outcome when participants are selfish and smart.</p>
        <p>Economic theory provides a conceptual framework, but good practice also uses data and experiment to tet hypotheses and identify things models may have missed.</p>
