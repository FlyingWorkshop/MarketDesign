<p>
        Why "rural hospitals?" Deferred acceptance is used to assign doctors to hospitalsâ€”some hospitals wondered if changing the algorithm would help them fill positions.

    <b id="rh">Definition: Rural Hospitals Theorem</b>
    <br>
    The sets of men and women who are unmatched is the same in <i>all</i> stable matchings.
    <br>
    <br>
<div class="alert alert-warning"><i><b>Caution:</b> This does not mean that the matchings are the same, just that the sets of men and women who are matched or unmatched is the same across all stable matchings.</i></div>

	<b>Proof:</b><br/>
    Let $M, W$ be the <i>sets</i> of men and women matched in the man-optimal stable matching (which is also woman-pessimal). Let $M', W'$ be the <i>sets</i> of men and women matched in some other stable matching. We seek to show that $M = M'$ and
    $W = W'$. Any man in $M'$ must also be matched in the man-optimal stable matching, so $M' \subseteq M$ $\ldots$ and also $|M'| \leq |M|$.  Similarly, since any woman in $W$ is no worse off in the alternative matching, $W \subseteq W'$ $\ldots$ and also $|W| \leq |W'|$. In any feasible matching, the number of matched men equals the number of matched women, so $|M| = |W|$ and $|M'| = |W'|$. We have: $\left|M'\right|\le\left|M\right|=\left|W\right|=\le\left|W'\right|=\left|M'\right|$, so all these are equal. Adding the set inclusions, we must have some $M=M'$ and $W=W'$. $\blacksquare$
